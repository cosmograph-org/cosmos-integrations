# How to contribute

This repository is a monorepo managed with the help of the npm's [Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces/) feature.

You can create a new package inside the _packages_ folder with its own _package.json_, folder structure, etc ...

When your integration package is ready, create a pull request. And after the package gets merged, it'll be released on NPM shortly.
